              The problem no one is measuring
            </h3>
            <p>
              You've invested in your team. Good people, good culture, good intentions.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the space itself? It's working on your people every single day. The acoustics that make concentration impossible. The lighting that signals 3 PM when it's 10 AM. The layout that leaves people with no real choice about how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most organisations don't see this because they're looking at people, not at space. The Spatial Wellness Audit gives you a clear picture of what your environment is doing, and a prioritised plan for what to do about it.

                  Step 1: Questionnaire
                </h4>
                <p>
                  You complete a detailed questionnaire about your workspace: acoustics, lighting, layout, flexibility, and more. Takes approximately 20–30 minutes.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  You upload photos of the key areas. No site visit needed. The audit works from photos and targeted questions.

                  No. The entire audit is done remotely, based on your questionnaire, photos, and optional measurements.

                  Who should complete the questionnaire?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Ideally a facility manager, HR lead, or office manager, someone who knows the space well. For smaller organisations, the founder or director works fine.

                  Within 5 working days after you submit your questionnaire and photos.

                  Perfect timing. The audit gives you a clear, evidence-based brief for architects and interior designers, and helps you avoid the most common spatial wellness mistakes from the start.
